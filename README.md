# WallpaperDownloader

This is a script that takes the most voted wallpaper in the subreddit r/wallpapers in 24 hours and then downloads the .json of that page, it parses the document to get the link of the image and then, it downloads it and sets it as your wallpaper.

* Currently, it only supports Windows.
